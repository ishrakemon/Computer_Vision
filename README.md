# Computer Vision
## Hand Tracking
This project uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** to perform real-time **hand landmark detection** using your webcam.  
It identifies 21 key points on each hand and visualizes them along with connection lines.

### Features
- Real-time hand landmark detection  
- Visual overlay of hand skeleton  
- FPS (frames per second) display  
- Works with any standard webcam  

## Technologies Used
- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe
